Bhakku & Hoalk @CryptoGroup NYUAD CCSAD 

there is a match on the msg but i am sure i had seen a byte orror on the key and it
dose not madch any has, but if you put an extra 2 digs on the end it is a hmac MD5

so maybe try a 2 dig crunch and hmac for the msg hash...

a hash is one way so the key hash must be the FLAG!! ??
