High-Level personnel was kidnapped earlier this month, and thanks to the police officers'
efforts, he's back safely. Unfortunately, the police failed in collecting any useful
information that could potentially lead them to the kidnappers.
His phone was configured to connect automatically to all Bluetooth devices close to
it, and it was equipped with a debugging software that he usually uses to troubleshoot
connectivity issues in his devices.
He sent us the debugging information for further investigation. Can you find anything
related to the kidnappers?

Maybe -- Steven Harvey ?
